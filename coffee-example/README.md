Play 2.x (Scala) is it a Spring MVC contender? – Introduction 
=============================================================

In this blog I created an demo application with Play, Slick, ScalaTest and ScalaMock. To test this execute `play test` you will see all the tests pass.

This sample talks about the classic Coffee/Supplier sample demonstrated with [Slick examples](http://slick.typesafe.com/doc/1.0.0/gettingstarted.html).

I have demonstrated a simple CRUD based application and built application with ScalaTest and ScalaMock

Refer CoffeesControllerTest.scala and DomainTest.scala for more details.
